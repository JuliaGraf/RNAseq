\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Pipelines}
A pipeline is a structured sequence of processes designed to carry out data analyses in a systematic and repeatable manner. It typically comprises a series of interconnected steps, including data input, preprocessing, algorithmic computation, and result generation. The use of pipelines allows for the automation of repetitive tasks, ensures the reproducibility of scientific experiments, and optimizes the execution of processes to run efficiently on different types of computing systems, such as servers, clusters, or cloud platforms.
\subsection{FAIR principles and reproducibility}
The FAIR principles offer a guideline to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of scientific data and workflows~\cite{wilkinson2016fair}. 
Among other things adding identifiers and extensive metadata to the data as well as using standardized communication protocols are part of the FAIR guiding principles. Meeting the requirements of the FAIR principles can assist to ensure reproducibility, which plays a major role in validating the results of scientific work.
\subsection{nf-core}
The standardization, portability and reproducibility of analysis pipelines are key issues within the bioinformatics community~\cite{ewels2020nf}. Many pipelines are built as custom in-house scripts which are tightly coupled to the computing environment in which they were developed. This can make it difficult for others to reproduce the results, which is a fundamental requirement for scientific findings. The nf-core community project collects a curated set of best-practice analysis pipelines built using Nextflow. Because the nf-core pipelines are written in Nextflow, they can be executed on most computational infrastructures and have native support for container technologies such as Docker and Singularity. Pipelines within nf-core must adhere to strict guidelines, are required to provide high-quality documentation and must provide test dataset in order to run automated continuous-integration tests whenever there is a change to the pipeline. On every pipeline release, a unique version tag is assigned that provides a static link between the pipeline’s implementation and its associated software dependencies. This way, nf-core assists in the development of high-quality pipelines that anyone can use.
\subsection{RNA-seq}
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely used technique for quantifying gene expression and allows for comprehensive profiling of the transcriptome \cite{Kukurba2015}.
One of the main goals of gene expression experiments is to identify transcripts that exhibit differential expression under various conditions.
A usual RNA-seq workflow involves isolating RNA from the sample, converting it to complementary DNA (cDNA), and sequencing it using an NGS platform.
The generated FastQ files contain sequencing reads and their associated base quality scores. These reads can then be aligned to a reference genome using mapping tools like STAR \cite{Dobin2012} or HISAT2 \cite{Kim2019}.
The alignment process allows for quantification of gene expression by counting the accumulation of aligned reads at specific loci in the reference genome \cite{Kukurba2015}. The resulting read counts reflect the transcript abundance, which is used to determine gene expression levels, which is used to infer gene expression levels \cite{Kukurba2015}.
Alternatively, alignment-free quantification methods, such as Salmon \cite{Patro2017} or Kallisto \cite{Bray2016}, can be used to estimate transcript abundance without requiring a full read alignment.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{The file structure of nf-core pipelines}
To ensure standardization, all nf-core pipelines have to be built using the nf-core template, which comprises many different files and folders. The most important files and directories are listed in Table~\ref{nfcorefiles}~\cite{nfcorefs}.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Important files and directories of an nf-core pipeline.}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lp{12cm}@{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Filename/Directory Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
        \verb|main.nf| & The main nextflow file which get executed when the pipeline is run. Calls workflows from the \verb|workflows/| directory. \\
        \verb|nextflow.config| & The main nextflow configuration file. It contains the default pipeline parameters, nextflow configuration options and defines different configuration profiles that can be used to run the pipeline. Imports files from the \verb|conf/| directory. \\
        \verb|README.md| & Contains basic information about the pipeline and usage. \\
        \verb|conf/| & Contains all of the configuration files. \\
        \verb|modules/| & Contains pipeline-specific and common nf-core modules. \\
        \verb|workflows/| & Contains the main pipeline workflows to be executed in the \verb|main.nf| file. \\
        \verb|subworkflows/| & Contains smaller subworkflows that typically consist out of a few modules chained together. \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{nfcorefiles}
\end{table}



\subsection{Where / how did you compute, which packages etc did you use (be FAIR when describing}
The pipeline is implemented in Nextflow and utilises the tools listed in table~\ref{table:1}.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Tools used in the pipeline and their version.}
    \label{table:1}
    \begin{tabular}{||c c||}
        \hline
        Tool & Version \\
        \hline\hline
        FastQC & 0.12.1\\
        picard MarkDuplicates & 3.2.0-1-g3948afb6b\\
        RSEM & 1.3.1\\
        Salmon & 1.10.3\\
        STAR & 2.7.11b\\
        Trim Galore! & 0.6.10\\
        Cutadapt & 4.9\\
        RNAseq & v1.0.0\\
        Nextflow & 24.04.4\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
It automatically installs all tools by employing docker containers, which ensure that the tools of the pipeline are run in the same computing environment on all devices~\cite{docker}.
The pipeline was run locally on our laptops.


\section{Results}
Our pipeline follows the essential steps of reading in a samplesheet, performing quality control, trimming and aligning reads to the reference genome, quantifying transcript abundance, and marking duplicate reads.
The samplesheet refers to a CSV file in which each row represents either a single-end FastQ file or two paired-end FastQ files, with a corresponding sample identifier.
Quality control is then performed on the sequencing files listed in the samplesheet, using the tool FastQC \cite{fastqc}. FastQC conducts a series of analyses on the raw sequencing data to give an overview of potential issues, presenting summary graphs and tables for easy visualisation.
Following quality control, the reads are trimmed with Trim Galore! \cite{trimgalore} to remove adapters and low-quality bases from the ends of the sequencing reads, resulting in compressed FastQ files.
The trimmed sequences are then aligned to the reference genome, producing compressed binary alignment map (BAM) files. This process is executed within a subworkflow that first utilizes STAR \cite{Dobin2012} to index the reference genome and subsequently aligns the reads to it. This subworkflow is divided into two processes, which allows for parallelization of the read alignment step.
Following alignment, the transcript quantification is performed in a second subworkflow consisting of three processes. First, reference transcripts are extracted from the genome by RSEM \cite{Li2011}, which prepares the reference by using a provided genome annotation file in GTF format.
In a second process, Salmon \cite{Patro2017} is used to index the reference transcripts generated by RSEM. Finally, the indexed reference transcripts, along with the sample reads, are processed by Salmon to produce transcript abundance tables in the third step of the alignment subworkflow. For each input sample, a TSV file is generated containing the transcript name, its length, its abundance in terms of Transcripts Per Million (TPM), and the estimated number of reads originating from each transcript.

\subsection{potentially describe aspects like speed with respect to parallelization (potentially compare for a couple of files to running plain bash...)}
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{How does nf-core achieve reproducibility and FAIR pipelines with focus on what your pipeline would still need to be able to be FAIR, reprod.}
For every nf-core pipeline, it must be possible to run the pipeline with \verb|--profile docker| and have all software requirements satisfied. Also, every container has to be versioned with a specific, stable version. This way, to reproduce an analysis that was conducted using a nf-core pipeline in a different computing environment, one only has to make sure to use the correct stable release tag. To find the matching nf-core pipeline for a specific use case, one can search for keywords on the nf-core website. All of the nf-core pipelines are open source and released under the MIT license which makes them accessible to everyone. Having a common repository for well-documented pipelines allows reusing pipelines rather than rewriting them.
\subsection{What is missing to your pipeline to be a strong RNA-seq workflow. what would be the next steps - Outlook}
While the pipeline successfully generates transcript quantification data, there are opportunities to improve its performance by incorporating additional processes. For instance, integrating support for Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) would allow for their extraction and downstream read deduplication, improving the accuracy of the results and reducing potential biases. The strandedness of sequencing reads could be inferred automatically by combining the subsampling of FastQ files with pseudoalignment, to determine whether reads correspond to the original RNA sequence or its complementary cDNA. Stranded RNA-Seq data offers advantages over non-stranded data, by improving the accuracy of transcript assembly and differential expression \cite{Signal2022}. Additionally, the removal of rRNA from reads can lead to the better detection of mRNA transcripts, which is important for the analysis of differential expression \cite{Pastor2022}. Finally, the generation of additional bigWig coverage files would allow for clearer visualisation of transcript coverage across the genome.
